aim: to make using 32 (or fewer) bit indices more ergonomic in rust 64bit builds (which currently requires continuous manual casting); additional pain comes from signed vs unsigned choice (often indices do require interaction with signed values, eg offsets in convolutions etc) There is hardware vectorized 32bit index support, and on a 16gb machine 64bit indices are overkill - 2^30 * 16byte objects will fill memory. Most applications will never fill memory with a single array. graphical applications often reason about explicit sizes e.g. with knowledge of what fits in GPU memory, optimal chunk sizes for rendering, etc.
